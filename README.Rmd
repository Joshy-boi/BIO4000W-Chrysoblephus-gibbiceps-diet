## R Markdown

# meta data- who got the data, where the scripts are, different folders put in picture too. multiple figures- do multiple code chunks 
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Red Stumpnose, echo= FALSE, out.width="60%", include=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='A male Red stumpnose (Chrysoblephus gibbiceps).Distinctive bulbous forehead and red bands clearly visible.'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/chrysoblephus gibbiceps pic.jpg')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

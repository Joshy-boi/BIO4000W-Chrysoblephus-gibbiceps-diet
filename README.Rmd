# meta data- who got the data, where the scripts are, different folders put in picture too. multiple figures- do multiple code chunks 
This repository was made for the UCT Biological Honours programme.
It centres around a dataset of stomach content analysis data on the diet of the endagered Seabream [*Chrysoblephus gibbiceps*](https://speciesstatus.sanbi.org/assessment/last-assessment/2954/)

The data were collected by third year marine biology students over a period of 2 years (2010-2012). Fish samples were provided by Dr Colin Attwood which he in turn acquired from previous research sampling or were donated to the university by commercial fishing companies (this species is sometimes caught as bycatch and the market is heavily restricted).

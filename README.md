This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<img src="images/chrysoblephus gibbiceps pic.jpg" alt="A male Red stumpnose (Chrysoblephus gibbiceps).Distinctive bulbous forehead and red bands clearly visible." width="60%" />
<p class="caption">

A male Red stumpnose (Chrysoblephus gibbiceps).Distinctive bulbous
forehead and red bands clearly visible.
</p>

</div>

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](README_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

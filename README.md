This repository was made for the UCT Biological Honours programme. It
centres around a dataset of stomach content analysis data on the diet of
the endagered Seabream [*Chrysoblephus
gibbiceps*](https://speciesstatus.sanbi.org/assessment/last-assessment/2954/)

The data were collected by third year marine biology students over a
period of 2 years (2010-2012). Fish samples were provided by Dr Colin
Attwood which he in turn acquired from previous research sampling or
were donated to the university by commercial fishing companies (this
species is sometimes caught as bycatch and the market is heavily
restricted).
